# The Customer Fallacy


Many IT Managers think they need to treat **the company as a customer**; they speak fondly of *"internal customers"* and of *"customer satisfaction"*. They are not entirely wrong, after all [ITIL](www.itil-officialsite.com "ITIL Home"), or its derivation, [ISO20000](it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_20000 "ISO20000 su wikipedia.it") are based on the idea of rendering a "service" to a "customer". There is nothing intrinsically wrong in seeing the company as a customer of its own IT function; rather it can be helpful in paying attention to where the money that keeps IT alive comes from, under the form of budget and salaries. What makes this line of thought a fallacy is that is fosters an **upside-down** vision of process and accountability. We all are customers at times, and we all know what we expect of sellers:

1. that they listen to us
1. that they understand us
1. that they are competent and prepared (and well-mannered)
1. and that they do not be come a nag.

Exactly because all of us are customers, it is difficult to notice how **the idea the customer has of a seller does not exist in nature**. To customers, a seller is somebody who spends his time waiting for a buyer to show up. But whoever tried to run a commercial activity on this blueprint would go bankrupt in a matter of months; on the other hand, IT professionals rarely have sales skills. The fallacy *"the company is my client"* is risky because of the **false sense of security** it induces in those who make their idea of a seller from their expectations as a customer.

The customer fallacy also rests on a long tradition, that still holds today in many organisations and in most IT minds, of IT being a purely reactive subject: prompt and competent, yes, but merely responding to explicit company requests. Exactly like the fantasy seller passively waiting for customers. This has allowed a concept of IT as a *non-core* company function. It comes as no surprise that many companies see no problem in outsourcing their IT, while few if any would externalise their CFO.

## What To Do

If you want to see your company as a client, fine; but then you should behave like a *real* seller, not like a fantasy one.

Just like in a *real* sales process, your customers require you to:
1. define your own services (on-catalog and made-to-order) and not wait for somebody to require them
1. identify your own clients (targeting)
1. periodically investigate customer needs, expressed or implied (market analysis)
1. proactively present your services (marketing, publicity, formal and informal commercial meetings)
1. manage all phases of the "sales" funnel (all states between "potential need" to "order", in sales terms)
1. process orders (order management)
1. manage post-sales (satisfaction, recurring contacts, new emerging needs)

Until yesterday, you were a good IT Manager if you reasoned in terms of:

* products
* technology
* autonomy
* costs
* quick reaction times
* technical hands-on skills.

Today, you must get new bearings based on:
* solutions and services
* company gestalt
* cross-functional workgroups (IT *and* non-IT)
* budget and SLAs
* proactivity
* managerial skills.

For an IT Manager there is no alternative to becoming an integral part of company management, just like any other function owner. This will mean less time available to spend on technology and more time to spend on the "managerial stuff" you so dread: relationships, internal policies and politics, reporting, meetings, budget. As [Marshall Goldsmith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Goldsmith "Marshall Goldsmith on wikipedia") has it, <cite>"what got you here won't get you there": you must not forget your skills, but understand they are no longer enough, and that you must acquire new, even more complex, ones.
