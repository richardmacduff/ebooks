# Why IT People Have No Career

In Sales, you may start as a junior account or marketing intern, then move on to being maybe Area Manager and after a few years you end up being Sales or Marketing Director or CMO. If you have "a passion or technology" you may become CIO on your way up. A bit of luck and you may end up CEO.

In Accounting you may start as an admin assistant, then become Internal Auditor or Financial Controller and in a few years find yourself Purchase Director, HR Director, CFO. Also, if you have "a passion or technology" you may become CIO on your way up. A bit of luck and you can end up CEO.

In IT, you can start as a junior programmer or junior systems analyst, become a senior programmer or senior Systems Architect and in a few years be a direct report to HR, Finance, Marketing, Sales, Purchase or to all of them at the same time. You will never make C-level and with a ton of luck you will not be externalised.

*Why?*

IT people think that it's a jerk's world out there, unable to understand the real value of IT people.

Non-IT people think that IT people are obsessive-compulsive, autistic ungrown teenagers with an inflationary ego and serious relational (and personal hygiene) issues who get exactly what they deserve in life.

The net result is that *everybody loses*. IT people have no career and companies waste immense human and financial capital while their best analytical minds are confined to the tech support room.

Let's say an unfashionable truism: in the company and on the market IT professionals are evaluated as little as possible, *just like anybody else*. The difference is that companies have a very clear understanding of the business value of anybody else. This is because outside of IT skill-sets are consolidated, as well as culturally assimilated. There are no doubts why Finance, Production, Marketing, Sales, Purchase, HR are key roles and why the company must insure they have appropriate resources: it's because of those functions that money flows into the company, is well managed and used wisely (or at least with the agreement of the top echelons). The company understands this. Anybody working in those functions understands this too, and can easily defend his case.

And what about IT? Well, from a company point of view IT is not a key function; it's a cost, and a risk. And it's managed as such.

Now, who should promote the business value of IT? IT people, of course. Only they don't. As I often say, *all functions work for business results, while IT works for its own, and only IT knows what they are*. (Skeptics are invited to ask their CEO how much he would pay to move availability up from 99.741% to 99.982%; when required to speak English you can say "one and a half less hours of IT downtime per month".)

And what about reporting? End-of-Quarter is when any function owner goes lengths to show allotted resources have been used wisely and productively for business results; not so with IT. In the best scenario, IT will show it has used up its (always insufficient, it will be stressed) resources to "solve" problems nobody understands and that will show up again anyway.

Is it such a surprise that IT is perceived as a pain in the ass?

Let's start by acknowledging some difficult truths:

1. IT people are unaware of their actual value for the business (they cannot see beyond the "technical level")
1. the business is unaware of why its IT people are valuable and important (it perceives them as a "necessary evil")
1. IT people do nothing to improve their condition.

Item 3 is the real culprit: IT people, who still think they are in the company to take care of IT, miss the forest for the trees. Can you picture a CMO saying his job it to "take care of campaigns"? Or a CFO saying "I'm here to make sure the budget is A-OK"?

No, eh? As a matter of fact, the last Marketing intern would not forget to cast his actions as an advantage for the company ("I make sure Board members have complete and up-to-date information; yeah, I mean, I xerox minutes and stuff, but that's a technical detail").

Only IT people are incapable of seeing beyond the keyboard. And the rest of the company values them accordingly:

>IT people are like electricians, plumbers, and that A/C guy that makes sure room temperature is always 10 degrees too high in summer and too low in winter. Yes, they are important, but they have no identity, they are interchangeable, outsource-able. They won't help you do your job better (they don't even know what your job *is* anyway); they make sure machines work so you can do your stuff in peace. The company is a team. IT people are janitors.

And how do IT people react? By validating this perception with their actions and their attitude. The irrational beliefs an IT person adopts  his narrative within the company is a ballast that, unless jettisoned, can sink even the most competent.

It is these irrational beliefs, these fallacies, that keep IT people from evolving into the vital business resource they need to be if we are to make anything at all of all this pervasive technology businesses seem to be drowning in.
