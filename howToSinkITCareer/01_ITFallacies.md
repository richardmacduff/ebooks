# The 13 Fallacies IT People Fall For


**IT fallacy**: *n.f. a **belief** (i.e. a conviction that does not pass a reality check) which is especially pernicious as it **underlies one's professional self-image**.
A fallacy, by and of itself, informs a large part of one's work-life: expectations, relationships with colleagues, with directs, with superiors and with the rest of the business.*

I know: you work your pants off to be recognised within the company, and you really do not feel like being told it's your own fault if you are valued on par with the office photocopier. Well, I do not like finding that out either. There's not a single time I manage to say it without a wrench in my gut. Some things keep on hurting. On the other hand, that's how things stand.

[PeterDrucker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker "Peter Drucker on Wikipedia"), the guy who invented management, once said:

> communication is what the listener does

which means there is no such thing as "I was misunderstood"; there's only **"I did not make myself clear"**. Where does misunderstanding come from? Most IT people see their job and their role through the lens of **irrational beliefs**, fallacies actually, that although superficially plausible are completely corrosive of the relationship with the company (or clients). Yes, I am saying most IT people, rational though they deems themselves to be, live and work not according to actual facts, but according to the distorted reality produced by the frame, or narrative, they impose on facts.

Don't believe me, do you? Well, here is a list of innocent statements. See how many you agree with. Although they sound harmless, each of them can guarantee that your career will go nowhere ever and that you will be perpetually confined in the tech support room.

1.  I have nothing to prove; it's obvious that what I do works
2.  if you have a business, IT is a price you must pay
3.  IT is too complex to be perfect
4.  I guarantee that the company has the best technology
5.  if yo don't follow the rules, you cannot expect things to work
6.  the company is my client
7.  I do whatever I am told, and still they complain
8.  should I be away, everything would stop
9.  this bunch of *lusers* should thank me, they don't know how lucky they are to have me
10.  the quality of a solution is everything
11.  solutions are more important than problems
12.  nobody unerstands technology here, my skills are not appreciated
13.  I cannot expect to be understood by people who could not get a regex right for their life.

Me, I stumble into them everywhere, while consulting, while holding a seminar; they are so widespread, so taken for granted, as to consitute the prevailing narrative among IT people about IT people and about how the world relates to them. These fallacies are not debated, they feed on themselves, spreading to generation after generation of new recruits. How about their effects? You decide: how happy you are with your career progression? And just between us, which of the above fallacies best fits your work situation, eh? Maybe you have another one to suggest?

There is no point discussing the fallacies themselves. If you are convinced, who am I to question your beliefs? What I want to do, instead, is to show you how the rest of the world reacts. Yes, I am going to show you *why* the people around you (that pathetic bunch of lusers who disrespect your expertise, you know) behave with you the way they do.
