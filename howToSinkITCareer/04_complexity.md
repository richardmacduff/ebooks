# The Complexity Fallacy

There are times when IT malfunctions. In those times, IT is under fire from all the company, especially from first lines. The kindest comment one can hear in those circumstances outside the IT room is "nothing ever @#!$ing works as it @#$!ing should!". Under the circumstances, the IT Director can be tempted to choose **the fallacy of complexity** as his line of defense:

>IT is too complex to be Flawless

which of course generates great empathy among the company, and replies that would make a veteran sailor proud.

To state that IT is too complex to be flawless is a bit like a financial broker casually musing that economy is not an exact science after announcing that your stock is now worth less the paper it is printed on. So effing what?

Is IT complex? You bet. Can we completely exclude it will give us any problem at all? Sure we cannot. Nonetheless, choosing this line of defense in the face of serious malfunctions is professionally suicidal. Here is how things should work if you are an IT Director:

1. you are paid to respond adequately to the company's IT needs
1. you are accountable for IT continuity and data security
1. when IT malfunctions, the buck stops at your desk.

These three conditions must all hold at the same time, or you are not an IT *Director*. That most companies still have to understand IT's strategic importance does not change a thing. **If you are a manager, you are there to take responsibility.** Hiding behind the excuse of complexity is unprofessional. And besides, it is no defence.

It is up to IT people in the company to present risk assessments; it is up to them to elaborate plans to minimize the likelihood of negative events; it is up to them to insure damages are minimal should negative events occur, and to guarantee prompt recovery anyway; and it is up to them to fight so that these plans are appropriately funded and resourced. This is true both in the large (Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plans) as in the small (e.g., configuration and installation policies to avoid the all-too-common *"it works on the colleague's desk!"*, server redundancy to insure controlled installs).

Many colleagues will admit, strictly off the record, that they are resigned to just manage the day-to-day, and choose peace of mind over contingency planning (and campaigning). After all, you cannot nag the CEO every day with the risk of impending doom, can you?

## What To Do

Yes you can. And you should. A CFO will have no problem tempesting the CEO day in and day out as needed; that's because the CFO knows that, if shit hits the fan, he will be held accountable for the choices he made as well as for those he did not. It is just the same for IT: in the end, accountability covers choices made as well as choices suffered (which is also why you should never say yes when you think no).

You, as an IT Manager are paid **to be accountable**:
1.  by **deciding** on what falls under your responsibility
2.  by **requiring clear directives** on what is outside your direct responsibility
3.  by **leaving a trail** (that means a written one) of what you requested and suggested, whenever no actual decision comes from up above
4.  by **requiring** the same of other functions.

Being accountable also means requiring accountability of others, even when they had rather choose peace of mind. But, wouldn't it be better to just go about one's business and not meddle in other people's? No. Because if you are the only accountable one around and you let others skip their responsibilities, this happens:

1. when all's well, others will claim a share of you merit: after all, you only did *your* part, no?
1. when problems arise, the fault is only yours, because all the time they spend skipping responsibility does not go idle, but  is spent building excuses and escapes.

Rings a bell?

No one expects perfection out of technology (with the possible exception of technology people). That is why it is the IT manager's duty to be (and make sure others are) ready. Once problems arise, the company expects you to show a corrective action that is both timely and properly executed. There is no sympathy for whiners.
