# The Cost Fallacy

Another very common fallacy is the one regarding its cost, seen as unavoidable. It goes like this:

> If you want a business, IT is a price you must pay!

The subtext, purged of harsh comments on the listener's mother, runs like this: *"&hellip;and you should thank me I'm not costing you more"*. Now, I believe we can all agree there is no way to run a business in the 21st century without IT. But I am sure we all agree there are better and worse ways to phrase such a truism, and the one we have just seen is quite possibly the worst, for at least these reasons:

* it shows IT as something extraneous to the business, the results it seeks and the problems it faces
* it carries on the "IT-as-a-cost" idea, that locks IT people in a tech support role and vanquishes all attempts at personal progress and function evolution
* it suggests no return for the costs of IT
* if IT is a cost, the main preoccupation within the company will be **to reduce it**



We have already seen how IT suffers of a lack of visibility, and hence of status. The fallacy of the unavoidable cost worsens the situation by offering a false sense of security when dealing with IT ()*"nothing bad can happen, IT is inevitable anyway"*) and obscuring the fact that all the company has stakes in IT-related decisions, even those that seem "only technical".

To a CEo, though, things sound differently: because if IT is a cost centre and not a value centre:

1. IT is not a strategic function, i.e., no Board seat for it (*"let themplay with their toys and let me work in peace"*)
1. fixed costs must be contained and continuously trimmed (*"enough upgrades, licences and new gear!"*)
1. IT is indistinguishable from an external supplier (*"a supplier comes, does his job and goes away without a fuss. And if there's any issue, I'll hold their invoice!"*)
1. an external supplier can be bound by contract to certain costs and levels of service. (*"you want my money, these are my conditions. I've had enough imploring for tech support"*)
1. outsourced IT guarantees fixed costs, fixed levels of service and when the contract ends I can negotiate even better conditions (*"There's no shortage of suppliers. If you are too expensive, I'll find a cheaper one!"*)

An IT that promotes the fallacy of the unavoidable cost has a clear and loud message for management: **outsource me!**. I submit there are smarter ideas to suggest.

### What To Do

What I suggested for improving direct and indirect visibility is certainly a good starting point. But it's not enough. IT people need to start changing their attitude towards the company. Recently, IT has exhibited some interest towards the idea of "service" ([ITIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL "ITIL on Wikipedia"), [ITSM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_Service_Management "ITSM on Wikipedia")) and governance ([COBIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBIT "COBIT on Wikipedia"), [ISO2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_20000 "ISO 20000 on Wikipedia"), [ISO27000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_27001 "ISO27001 on Wikipedia")) but most IT practitioners (including most IT Directors) still do not give the idea their full support; some dangerous preconceptions must be put aside

1. *users are not lusers*, they are the people who give IT professional a job
1. the company does not need to "understand IT"; rather, IT must show its necessity *towards company goals*
1. a cost is not an independent variable: either the cost brings value or it must be eliminated
1. it's up to IT, not to the company, to show and quantify the value produced by IT and, more generally, to justify its cost.

It is not by chance that so many IT "managers" have no budget authority, or that they functionally report to the Financial Director: it is the clear indication that the company sees IT as a pure cost to be contained. IT-as-a-cost, together with IT-people-As-tecnicians, are a huge **obstacle** for the recognition of IT as a peer among other functions, or as the engine of innovation within the company. At the very least it is us IT people, who have a clear stake in it, that should **remove the obstacle** and recast **IT as the company engine**.
