# The Evidence Fallacy

Many in IT deem themselves above explaining:

*   they  consider explaining a bit like belittling their effort (*"if it's a good job, you notice it. No need to make a fuss"*)
*   acting outside the limelight fits the **reduced social skills** so common within the profession (and so necessary, as we shall see). Indeed many in IT have, or have developed, a strong sense of repulsion for all activities with a strong social component. Unfortunately, self-promotion falls under this category.

I call this milestone of "autistic IT" the **fallacy of evidence**, or black-box complex. It goes like this:

> I don't need to prove anything to anybody: things work, so it's obvious I'm doing a good job.

(If you are more interested in finding a solution than in analysing the problem, just go to [What To Do](#what-now).) Work in IT is almost entirely immaterial and, as such, *invisible* to non-IT people. That's not all: most of it is also of a pre-emptive nature. Just like a fire alarm or a vaccination, the quality of it depends on the *non-occurrence* of an event. We know that this is not a setting where the logical-deductive abilities of humans work very well.

To an IT person, "nothing to report, all conditions normal" is the best demonstration of the qulity of his work. To the company, on the other hand, it is completely **irrelevant**. What the company sees of the work of IT is what gets in the way of business as usual: malfunctions and technical support.

Let's think of electrical power, or running water: when the work, it is just *normal* that they do, we barely notice them. When they stop working, we have no problem invoking the wrath of the gods against the power company or the water company. All the work needed to allow what we lightheartedly take for granted when we hit a switch or turn a faucet is completely *invisible*, it just **does not exist for us**.

Exactly because we consider certain services as *normal*, when they stop our thoughts do not go to the valiant engineers and technicians sweating their pants off to reestablish the service, no. The technicians and engineers get our curses because **they did't do their job well**. The same holds for IT. **The company is aware of IT only when it becomes a problem.** (When tech support is busy fixing a problem, the nature of the problem is IT's business. Office dwellers only see the time they are wasting.) *Inside people's heads*, all of the above leads to some unfortunate conclusions.

1.  IT _creates_ problems (when you see them around it's because there is a problem, ergo...)
2.  IT does not work (or there would be no need for their support)
3.  IT costs too much (tech support is anyway a *fraction* if IT work within a company)
4.  IT guys have a great time while we work (IT=tech support, so if they are not around doing support they are locked up in their techie room playing World of Warcraft or some such out of the company's broadband).

Another sad news is that even arguing that the above conclusions are fallacious **is pointless**. (We IT people are for experimental evidence, so whoever wants to go to their CEO and say "your conclusions make no sense" is free to do it and to share the results). The issue here is not whether something is true or false, but if people believe it or not. It's not about facts, it is about *convictions*. And if the company is convinced you cost too much, or that you create problems rather than solving them, or that after all you have a jolly good time with your toys while other people actually work for a living, **it's your problem**, not the company's.

### <a name="what-now"></a>What To

Step one to forgo a fallacy: acknowledge that other people's point of view is on par with one's own, even in terms of likelihood. We can discuss all day but neither IT nor the company are incapable of sound reasoning. As a matter of fact, if we accept the premises of either one, we'll find out its conclusions are inevitable. I suppose I can take it as read that IT work is not promptly apparent to the rest of the company. We need to make it **visible**, and to do so in terms that the company can relate to **its own** work (hint: unless you are a datacentre, no one really gives a damn for uptime). Visibility can be attained either directly or indirectly, and here is how.


#### Indirect Visibility How-To:

1.  recurrent reporting on how IT affected improved **other functions** in terms of time and cost reduction (faster ERP/LAN, shortened support times, reduced number of support calls, etc.)
2.  tailored recurrent suggestions to other functions:
  * *"we noticed you are using SuchAndSuch. Here is a link to an online seminar for medium-level to advanced users you may find helpful"*
  *   *"we noticed you are not using SuchAndSuch. Could we suggest we hold a no-nonsense introductory seminar for you at your earliest convenience?"*

#### Direct Visibility How-To:

1.  create a dashboard (hint: physical ones, like a giant screen in a shared area, tend to be more noticed) reporting in real time the core IT metrics that have a direct business value
  * in this case, since they are made so perspicuous, even negative metrics (*"X weeks without a system down!"*) work
  * but they work better if they are turned into positive ones (*"the ERP marks X week of 100% availability"* --which means the same of the above but can be actually understood by Accounting)
2.  recurrent (even weekly) needs-gathering meetings between IT and other function owners, before these needs become tech support requests (see under: IT does not work)
3.  recurrent seminars on the most adopted or the most recently installed applications/packages
4.  recurrent User Satisfaction polls.

IT can break out of its autistic phase as soon as it stops pretending it's the rest of the company that saves it. **The company's business is not to understand  IT**, but in the business of using IT to reach its goals. On the other hand, **it's up to IT to self-market appropriately** with the rest of the company, and to do so by using the company's language of times and costs, not the technical language of performances and specs.
